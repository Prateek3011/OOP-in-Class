<<<<<<<REFLECT>>>>>>>

For this DIY workshop, I had to spent so much time to make it work. In order to solve the workshop, there were several problems to be solved. First, what functions should be set to send and receive values. In order to solve this problem, it was necessary to think deeply about how the order of the workshops proceeds, what inputs and outputs are desired in the workshops, and what they want as a result. Therefore, I carefully read and organized the details of the workshop to determine the names and roles of the necessary functions. Second, we had to write the code for each role of the function. The roles played by each function were fixed, and the code required for each function was different to implement the defined role. For example, constructors, destructors, functions to set names, functions to set extensions, functions to determine names, functions to determine extensions, and so on. Finally, we had to make sure that all the functions were connected and working properly. During this process, I had to constantly check whether the buffer was resolved, the allocated values were properly resolved, or the correct values were exchanged. Finally, a for statement was used for the final output. In this part, continuous confirmation was necessary because different values had to be given according to strlen. This workshop gave me a lot of challenges and it seems that there is still a process to organize the code.
