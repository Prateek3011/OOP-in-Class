******* Finishing the Milestone.
>>I was able to study various things while completing the final assignment. I was able to re-study and learn the dynamical allocate memory, inheritance, copy constructor, copyu assignment, operators, etc. that I had learned in class so far. I felt that I still needed to study and get used to the parts that I always struggled with every assignment. I also learned that milestones are not the end, but the beginning. Through this milestone, I was able to handle the pos system. The actual pos system would be much more sophisticated and complex, but I think I was able to indirectly experience the system that runs a little bit. Also, through milestones, I was able to find out how much I was lacking in. Of course, it is true that many parts are lacking. Still, it felt pretty good to finish the milestone by myself.
